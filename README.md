There is a `/health` endpoint that checks for the health of the app. This sets up an expressjs server and listens on the environment variable `PORT`. It's not part of the configuration file and needs to be passed as an environment variable

## Local Setup
All the dependencies will setup using docker.
Go to `legacy-terms-processor/dependencies-docker` and follow instructions below:
1. update env.sh to match your environment and run `source env.sh`
2. run `docker-compose up`
This will setup Zookeeper, Kafka and Informix services

## Local deployment
- Given the fact that the library used to access Informix DB depends on Informix Client SDK.
We will run the application on Docker using a base image with Informix Client SDK installed and properly configured.
For deployment, please refer to next section 'Local Deployment with Docker'

## Local Deployment with Docker

1. Make sure that Kafka and Informix are running as per instructions above.

2. Go to `docker` folder

3. Rename the file `sample.api.env` to `api.env` And properly update the IP addresses to match your environment for the variables : KAFKA_URL, INFORMIX_HOST.

Here is an example:
```
KAFKA_URL=192.168.31.8:9092
INFORMIX_HOST=192.168.31.8
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=8QovDh27SrDu1XSs68m21A1NBP8isvOt
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=3QVxxu20QnagdH-McWhVz0WfsQzA1F8taDdGDI4XphgpEYZPcMTF4lX3aeOIeCzh
AUTH0_URL=https://topcoder-dev.auth0.com/oauth/token
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https://m2m.topcoder-dev.com/
```

4. Once that is done, go to run the following command

```
docker-compose up
```

5. When you are running the application for the first time, It will take some time initially to download the image and install the dependencies

## Code style checks
To check the code style use the following commands
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Check code style: `npm run lint`
3. Check code style and fix some styling issues: `npm run lint:fix`

## Verification
Refer to `Verification.md`
